            <p>
              <span>This page is interesting because it's just a summary of my day.</span>
              <span>Maybe I'll write about four things to make four paragraphs.</span>
              <span>The first topic will be just a hello and what I wish to accomplish on this page</span>
              <span>The last one of four will be where you can find me online and how that's going.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>So now we need a second paragrah eh?</span>
              <span>Well this should easy, just tell them how your legs feel. </span>
              <span>Or just try to portray your way the body feels.</span>
              <span>What have I eaten?</span>
              <span>What about the exercises and soreness of things</span>
              <span>Have I accomplished any milestones?</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>For the third paragraph we will be setting a goal.</span>
              <span>This could be a goal longterm or shorterm.</span>
              <span>It's just a paragraph that explains the goal</span>
              <span>And how we are going to accomplish the goal</span>
              <span>How i truly feel about it as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>This last paragraph is so eeassy!</span>
              <span>We are just going to be all like, don't forget..</span>
