        <span>Imagine doing the nth child and doing alternate colors for the text. </span>
        <span>Also use the P tage and span tag to seperate idea topics to form more of a structure.</span>
        <span> And keep in mind to keep it real simple and post images more and popping words.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Getting ideas for posting content to twitch and such. </span>
        <span> Thinking about streaming the morning and nights on twitch and youtube/ snapchat throughout the day. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Also getting the hang of gimp and github. </span>

        <span>And lets get the Checklist page started.</span>
        <span>I'm thinking it should be like an actual check list...</span>
        <span>What if I used the format for this page for other pages just with the actual topics in mind?</span>
        <span>Hell yea man.</span>

          The Turn Around; The comeback
        </h2>
          <img class="ideas left" src="./res/img/gator-riding.png" />
          <p class="ideas">
            Really contemplating hard about how to livestream.<br />
            I want to do it outside but I know the battery life won't be long.<br />
            So I'm thinking about just doing small streams but many of them.<br />
            I could sneak out of work and do a meditation class in the forest somewhere.<br />
            But where do I stream at?<br />
            Ok, say I stream my niche theme on twitch, and post the updates on Youtube/ socialmediates.<br />
            That would probably work.<br />
            And then I would like to catch up with the audience at the end of the day as I write my blog posts.<br />
            Thinking about putting css grid for the schedule Tomorrow page.<br />
            The today page will be the update video on youtube and such and i can write a message and a picture.<br />
            So you have words, video and images for the today update page.<br />
            Thats dope.<br />
            <img class="ideas right" src="./res/img/puppies-question.gif" />
            Lol reading this is going to be funny because it's just listing things but in paragraph form.<br />
            I'm hyped about this webpage.
            This is the day that determines tomorrow.<br />
            There are all kinds of things I can do to feel successful whenI go to sleep in 12 hours.<br />
            Lets go.<br />
            Consider keeping the list style by using spans as the li's.<br />
            Also you can just manipulate the border radius to give it that feel.<br />
            I feel like this page could be cool if I developed some attractive structure to it.<br />
            I want to make a page that lists my activities that make me feel successful.<br />
            Maybe the first letter of the list can be capitalized bold? <br />
            How about a Archive page? <br />
            So instead of deleting the content, put it aside on a seperate page. <br />
            Use Youtube to stream outside and Twitch for inside. <br />
            What's up with the logo? :(

            Thought of a good schedule for Twitch.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            Use phone to stream a bit in the forest, then go inside to live stream writing the daily blog / updating website.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            You can also stream the morning stretch.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            You could set up the mic we have and use the macbook for the webcam. Looking to getting a webcam for the pc and a mechanical keyboard possibly one that lights up.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            Basically came to the thought that maybe I'm not striving to be the most entertaining person on the web, but at least I will be "A person on the web" and a person that I want to be. And we will see what happens.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I look forward to ways of updating websites using git or remotely through git.
          </li>
          <li>
            Might change the layout of this page to a paragraph page and add shap-outside css to it. Hell yea.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also want to mark my keyboard somehow like i did at the office
          </li>

            Thinking I might reset the wweeks ideas after sunday.

            I think this site has the potential to really get my brain on paper in a way.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I will have stuff that makes me think, laugh and cry. That's why I am thinking about putting a page with daily updates on myself and herbs/ medicine.
          </li>
          <li>
            This webpage will just be a portal into my mind. Keeping my life organized on this page.

            Feels like I found my theme yesterday in the forest. Less is more. I feel it's my voice to sit still and do nothing in the forest. Make comments on things that appear in the now.

            Trying to figure out my Twitch schedule. It's very confusing but I trust the process.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I like the idea of staying active on all the social media platforms. But should'nt there be more of a presence on one of them? I feel like Twitch should be the Main platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hmm.. how about dedicate the forest time for twitch, and when I'm away on twitch, the other platforms are for when I have time throughout the day.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            <img src="./res/img/thinker.jpg" />
            And instead of posting my twitch streams on youtube, maybe i can do different style vids. Like how to's and questions. Like youtube should be more personal I feel. Hmm.. actually, approach youtube the same as like instagram. When there's something cool and it's not forest time, record it or go live.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the other platforms to connect with people, to say hi. And you can't say hi for 3 hours so lol.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I'm jumping on board with Richard. we got this.
