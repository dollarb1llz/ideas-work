            I feel like a true american citizen gets involved by voting for what's right.
          </li>
          <li>
            And I know the struggle of raising your voice against the system. That's why I want to support people who do. While at the same time just being as real as I can
          </li>
          <li>
            I haven't had the experience to talk about things like this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stick to speaking from your heart. From your own experiences, not experiences of others on the internet. I get that.
          </li>
          <li>
            Like, I'm just a guy, like many other guys. But i'm woke. As a woke individual, I know of the corruption, I found the people to support and I know my limits.
          </li>
          <li>
            I can still say so much by living raw. But now I can also live raw and be a patriot by making money, supporting people who also stand for whats right and getting involved.

            Once I get into a habit of posting Youtube clips, I will have to begin to merge more towards D.tube and bitchute and also start supporting them as well as gab and infowars.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            There's so many people to support! It's great.
          </li>
          <li>
            All I can do is eat strong foods, practice what I think is right (Being a strong, smart and kind human being) and support those who are pro-americano or free market.
          </li>
          <li>
            yes I have a voice. And it's not very loud but it's damn near effective. It's my actions dude. my actions.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            My voice is just leading by example. And that doesn't involve me worrying about what people are doing across the globe.

            I am billy Hunter, I don't give a shit about people. I do me. I do what's best for my body. I observe things for what they are and question them. I know the power of the forests and earth. I am a rounded individual who believes in truth, righteousness and freedom. And I don't even have to say a word. I'm a quite person.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am an observer of life.

            I have goals, just like anyone else.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want the world to be more hard working then you yourself needs to be hard working and set goals and make money and use that money for good.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I want to find someone to support with their music while not using dumb platforms.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            is it possible to just buy music from an artist? like comon man
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I know Twitch is owned by amazon and I will eventually find an alternative. I think Beam is someting to consider.
