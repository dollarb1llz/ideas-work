      <p>
        <span>The greatest feeling is knowing you got up before the sun.</span>
        <span>It's hard, but it's like the most important key to success.</span>
        <span>It helps to prepare clothes and just actions in general</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>The magical potion of healing is a great way to start the day. </span>
        <span> I just need something to fill the gap between making the brew.</span>
        <span>It's not like it tastes any good.</span>
        <span>It just makes you feel good, happy, successful. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>I like to watch videos to learn.</span>
        <span>And when I watch educational videos, it's very rewarding.</span>
        <span>You can literally learn anything, but I make sure I stick to the important videos first like coding.</span>
        <span>Also have to beware of the possibility to get caught up in some titties.</span>

      <p>
        <span>Getting passed the Tea process without eating is key man.</span>
        <span>Eating makes me unable to stretch.</span>
        <span>If I can't stretch, I feel very unfulfilled.</span>
        <span>And that's no way to start the day.</span>
        <span>We usually stretch as the sun rises</span>
